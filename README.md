# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.


# Running the tests

The tests can be successfully run by opening `index.html` in any modern browser. The testing framework is included and tests can be run from either the filesystem or a server.
